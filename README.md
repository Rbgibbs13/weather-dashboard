Weather Dashboard with Server-Side API

A simple dashboard that allows you to input a city and get the current weather and a 5 day forecast with 3 hour segments.  The searches are stored locally and automatically repopulated every time you load the page.

Almost all of the code is original. I took one line of code from StackOverlow at (time of writing) line 330 and the ConvertUnix function is referenced from MDN.  Theres comments above that line linking to the code, and I will provide them here with the other links.

Other than that I reference W3 or MDN regularly to correct syntax or help fix bugs.
