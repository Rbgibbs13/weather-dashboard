Weather Dashboard with Server-Side API

Almost all of the code is original. I took one line of code from StackOverlow at (time of writing) line 330 and the ConvertUnix function is referenced from MDN.  Theres comments above that line linking to the code, and I will provide them here with the other links.

Other than that I reference W3 or MDN regularly to correct syntax or help fix bugs.
